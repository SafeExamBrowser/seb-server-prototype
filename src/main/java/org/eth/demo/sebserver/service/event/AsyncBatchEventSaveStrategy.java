/** Approach 2 to handle/save client events internally
 *
 * This Approach uses a queue to collect ClientEvents that are stored later. The queue is shared between some
 * worker-threads that batch gets and stores the events from the queue afterwards. this approach is less blocking from
 * the caller perspective and also faster on store data by using bulk-insert
 *
 * A disadvantage is an potentially multiple event data loss on total server fail. The data in the queue is state that
 * is not stored somewhere yet and can't be recovered on total server fail.
 *
 * If the performance of this approach is not enough or the potentially data loss on total server fail is a risk that
 * not can be taken, we have to consider using a messaging system/server like rabbitMQ or Apache-Kafka that brings the
 * ability to effectively store and recover message queues but also comes with more complexity on setup and installation
 * side as well as for the whole server system.
 *
 * TODO trigger the run of worker threads on exam start and stop them if no exam is currently running */
