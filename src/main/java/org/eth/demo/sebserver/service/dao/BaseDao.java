 * mapper interfaces of MyBatis and is a transition layer between the data access- and the business-layer. In the
 * service-DAO layer some major data persistence aspects lime transactions and/or caching, should be covered
 *
 * The service-DAO layer should not throw any exceptions that may happen on this or lower level. Exceptions should be
 * catch and logged and if there is a return value expected, a NULL-Value should be returned that can be recognized as
 * such from the above layers.
